## Project Title

My first HTML and CSS self promotion website made in bootcamp. It represents my LLC, JN Collective Design.

## Description

This project is a brief of my accomplishment and direction. It contains a brief about me, a paid for website (Put14in.com) of a spinoff of my current LLC, my first HW, and an example of a social media strategy.

I started with copying dev tools used in class examples to this folder for use in this project to streamline coding process.

## Roadmap

As time and the class continues; this website will improve with my works. The img blocks will become cleaner. The background, stlying, borders and links will improve.
